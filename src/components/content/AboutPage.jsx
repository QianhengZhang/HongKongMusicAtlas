                    This interactive web map explores the cultural geography of Hong Kong
                    through the lens of Cantonese pop music. Many Canto-pop songs reference
                    specific neighborhoods, landmarks, and streetsâ€”this project visualizes
                    those lyrical references as a dynamic, map-based storytelling experience.

                    Cantonese pop music has long been a reflection of Hong Kong's urban
                    identity and social changes. Songs often reference specific locations
                    that hold cultural, historical, or personal significance to both
                    artists and listeners.

                    Song data includes lyrics in both Chinese and will include English translation in the future.
                    Other information includes artist information,
                    album covers, YouTube links, and historical context for each referenced
                    location. The database is designed to grow over time as more songs
                    are discovered and added.

                    We welcome contributions and suggestions! If you know of a Canto-pop
                    song that references a specific Hong Kong location, or if you'd like
                    to help improve the project, please get in touch. <br />
