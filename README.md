# Hong Kong Music Atlas

**Hong Kong Music Atlas** is an interactive web map that explores the cultural geography of Hong Kong through the lens of Cantonese pop music. Many Canto-pop songs reference specific neighborhoods, landmarks, and streetsâ€”this project visualizes those lyrical references as a dynamic, map-based storytelling experience.
